# CV-CNN
This is a repository for predicting electro-organic reaction performance using cyclic voltammogram (CV) images as learning material with convolutional neural network (CNN). 
Since raw cyclic voltammetry data points are rarely disclosed, the repository also provides a tool for extracting individual CV curves from published figures. 
The curated dataset comprises 150 CVs corresponding to 50 individual reactions, each represented by a mixture CV, a substrate CV, and a catalyst CV. Plural-view strategy is employed for the reactivity calssification. and reactions with yield below 10% were labelled as unreactive
